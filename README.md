# Neuro-Cognitive Decision Simulator
A functional implementation of computational neuroscience principles.

## Overview
This project simulates human decision-making based on the **Predictive Coding** framework. It categorizes user behavior into neuro-cognitive profiles such as 'Exploration vs. Exploitation' and 'Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up' processing.

## Core Concepts
* **Uncertainty Management:** Uses branching logic to simulate how the brain minimizes 'Prediction Error.'
* **Perceptual Hierarchies:** Evaluates whether users prioritize global 'Big Picture' patterns or fine-grained mechanistic details.
* **Mechanistic Fidelity:** Decisions are mapped to ensure behavioral outcomes align with theoretical cognitive models.

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** JavaScript
* **Architecture:** Data-driven State Machine (JSON-decoupled logic)
